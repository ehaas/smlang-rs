# Change Log

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](http://keepachangelog.com/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Add support for defining States and Events attributes using `states_attr` and `events_attr` fields

### Changed

- [breaking] Remove `derive_states` and `derive_events` fields in lieu of `states_attr` and `events_attr` to define attributes generically
- Bumped `syn` dependency to version 2

## [v0.8.0] - 2024-08-07

### Added

- Add transition callback. A function which is called for every transition. It has default empty
implementation.
- Add support for implicit and wildcard internal transitions

### Changed

- [breaking] Renamed custom_guard_error flag to custom_error as it is not guard specific anymore
- [breaking] Re-ordered on_exit/on_entry hooks calls
- [breaking] New `transition_callback` has replaced `log_state_change` as it is more flexible.

## [0.7.0] - 2024-07-03

### Added

- Add support for async guards and actions
- Add name to statemachine and make dot output stable and unique ([issue-62](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/pull/62))
- Add derive macros to states and events ([issue-62](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/pull/62))
- Add hooks to `StateMachineContext` for logging events, guards, actions, and state changes
- Add support multiple guarded transitions for a triggering event
- Add support for guard boolean expressions in the state machine declaration
- There are now `on_entry_<snakecase_statename>` and `on_entry_<snakecase_statename>` functions
defined to allow handling entry and exit from all state machine states. These have a default empty
implementation.
* The expanded code is now written to `target/smlang-expansion-<name|default>.rs` during the build
process.

### Fixed

- Fixes multiple issues with lifetimes ([issue-57](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/57), [issue-58](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/pull/58))

### Changed

- `StateMachine::new` and `StateMachine::new_with_state` are now const functions
- Fixed clippy warnings
- [breaking] Changed guard functions return type from Result<(),_> to Result<bool,_>
- [breaking] Changed action functions return type from () to Result<NextStateData,_>
- [breaking] Disallow guards mutable access to the context
- [breaking] Renamed GuardError to Error as it is now used for both guards and actions

## [v0.6.0] - 2022-11-02

### Fixed

- Updated the link checker in the Github actions to use [lychee](https://github.com/lycheeverse/lychee).

### Added

- Starting state can now contain data ([issue-34](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/34))
- Allow explicit input states before wildcard input state([issue-47](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/pull/47)

### Changed
- Custom guard error types are now specified as a type of the `StateMachineContext` to allow for
  more versatile types.

## [v0.5.1]

### Fixed
* [#36](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/36) Attempts to use actions and guards with
  inconsistent input, event, and output state data will be flagged as compiler errors.

### Added

## [v0.5.0]

### Added

- Changelog enforcer added to CI
- State data now supports lifetimes ([issue-26](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/26))
- New example [dominos.rs](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/blob/master/examples/dominos.rs) illustrating a method of event propagation ([issue-17](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/17))
- Input states support pattern matching and wildcards ([issue-29](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/29))

### Fixed
- PartialEq for States and Events based on discriminant only ([issue-21](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/21))
- Updated the CI badges ([issue-30](https://github.com/korken89/smlang-rs/issues/30))

## [v0.4.2]

### Fixed

### Added

- Initial state can be specified at runtime.

### Changes

## [v0.4.1] -- YANKED

## [v0.4.0]

### Added

- Introduce a new named syntax, supporting `guard_error`, `transitions` and `temporary_context`
- The ability to define custom guard errors

## [v0.3.5]

### Fixed

- No longer needed to define each action, the same action can now be reused.

### Added

## [v0.3.4]

### Fixed

### Added

- Added syntax and support for a temporary context which is propagated from `process_event`. This
  allows for usage in systems where the normal context cannot take ownership, such as when having a
  reference which is only valid during the invocation of the state machine. For an example of this
  feature see `examples/guard_action_syntax_with_temporary_context.rs`.

### Changes

## [v0.3.3]

### Fixed

- Now compatible with `#![deny(missing_docs)]`.

## [v0.3.2]

### Fixed

- Having states with data associated, but no action to set this data, caused arcane errors. This is now fixed.

### Added

- Destination state may now have a type associated with it

### Changes

## [v0.3.1]

### Changes

* Better documentation and examples
* Graphviz diagrams only generated if feature is enabled

## [v0.3.0]

### Fixed

* API documentation should now be correctly generated in a project

### Changes

* [breaking] Most derives on `States`, `Events` (`Copy`, `Clone`, `Debug`) and trait bounds on
`StateMachineContext` are removed.
* [breaking] All returns of state are now by reference
* [breaking] Guards now take self my mutable reference, this to allow for context modifications. Quite common
when receiving the same event N times can be accepted as a transition. Before one would have to have
a long list of states to go through.
* Most function are made `#[inline]`

## [v0.2.2]

### Added

* Lifetime support added to guards and actions

## [v0.2.1]

### Added

* Basic lifetime support for event data

## v0.2.0

### Added

* Support for generating a graphviz file over the state machine
* Support for data in events
* Support for data in states
* Change log added
